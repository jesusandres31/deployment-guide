# Introduction

The deployment process of web applications can be confusing due to its varied approaches and the additional tasks involved. While services, containers, and continuous integration and deployment environments can enhance this process, they don't always ensure an optimal solution. The lack of documentation can still lead to confusion for certain team members. This guide aims to establish a deployment strategy for small software development teams, inspired by GitOps methodology. By simplifying the complexities of web application deployment, even in smaller environments, the proposed strategy seeks to execute the deployment process systematically and efficiently.

## Collaborative Deployment Workflow

Encourage team involvement in deployments by offering a centralized
repository for contribution to strategies, sharing insights, and
collective issue resolution.

## Streamlined Deployment Process

Optimize deployment across different environments with clear
instructions, scripted procedures, and best practices to minimize
downtime and ensure smooth transitions.

## GitOps Documentation

Use Git repositories a s a single source of truth for managing
infrastructure and deployments files to enables version-controlled
documentation alongside your codebase.
