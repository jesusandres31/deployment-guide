# Introduction

The deployment process of web applications can be confusing due to its varied approaches and the additional tasks involved. While services, containers, and continuous integration and deployment environments can enhance this process, they don't always ensure an optimal solution.

This guide aims to establish a deployment strategy for small software development teams, inspired by GitOps methodology. By simplifying the complexities of web application deployment, even in smaller environments, the proposed strategy seeks to execute the deployment process systematically and efficiently.
